# Content

The main dataset includes information for 732 Norwegian words. A second table also includes measures of how frequently each word is used in Norwegian, both on the internet (as observed in the Norwegian Web as Corpus dataset) and when an adult is talking to a child. The latter is commonly called “child directed speech” and is abbreviated as “CDS”. 
Main data
* ID_CDI_I    	ID in the Norwegian CDI I (Kristoffersen et al. 2012)
* ID_CDI_II    	ID in the Norwegian CDI II (Kristoffersen et al. 2012)
* Word_NW    	Entry as given in the database Norwegian Words (Lind et al, 2015)
* Word_CDI    	Entry as given in the CDI (Kristoffersen et al. 2012)
* Translation  	English translation
* AoA     	Age of acquisition: the age (in months) where 50% of the norming sample (Simonsen et al., 2014) are reported to produce the word
* VSoA     	Vocabulary size of acquisition: the vocabulary size (in spans of 20 words) where 50% of the norming sample (Simonsen et al., 2014) are reported to produce the word
* Lex_cat     	Lexical category as given by Kristoffersen et al. (2012)
* Broad_lex     	Broad lexical category based on Bates et al. (1994)
* Freq     	Frequency in the corpus Norwegian Web as Corpus (NoWaC) (Guevara 2010), taken to approximate frequency in adult speech
* CDS_freq     	Frequency in child-directed speech based Simonsen (1990) and Garmann-Norwegian (Garmann, 2016; Garmann et al., in press)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
