# Content
The main dataset includes information for 732 Norwegian words. A second table also includes measures of how frequently each word is used in Norwegian, both on the internet (as observed in the Norwegian Web as Corpus dataset) and when an adult is talking to a child. The latter is commonly called “child directed speech” and is abbreviated as “CDS”. 
Main data
•	IDCDII: Word ID from the Norwegian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories, version 1
•	IDCDIII: Word ID from the Norwegian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories, version 2
•	Word_NW: The word in Norwegian
•	Word_CDI: The form of the word found in the Norwegian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories
•	Translation: the English translation of the Norwegian word
•	AoA: how old a child generally is was when they this this word, in months (Estimated from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories)
•	VSoA: how many other words a child generally knows when they learn this word (rounded up to the nearest 10)
•	Lex_cat: the specific part of speech of the word
•	Broad_lex: the broad part of speech of the word
•	Freq: a measure of how commonly this word occurs in Norwegian
•	CDS_Freq: a measure of how commonly this word occurs when a Norwegian adult is talking to a Norwegian child
Norwegian CDS Frequency
•	Word_CDI: The word from, as found in the Norwegian adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories
•	Translation: The English translation of the Norwegian word
•	Freq_NoWaC: How often this word is used on the internet
•	Freq_CDS: How often this word is used when talking to children (based on two Norwegian CHILDES corpora)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
